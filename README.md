# YSC3232 Week01 HelloWorld Assignment.

## Exercise: 
Create a github repository, and push an hello world program in it, with a successful run of the program using Travis and a Makefile.

## How to compile:
1. In the terminal, ```cd``` to the folder where the java file is (call it ```Hello.java```):

2. Compile using ```javac Hello.java```
No executable file is created. Instead, there is a Hello.class.

3. After compilation just type ```java Hello``` 
Java will look for a main method in that class and start execution from here.
